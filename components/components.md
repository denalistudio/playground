# Components

A *component* is a **standalone section of code** that can be added to any Comma website.

|  name | description | people | date |
|-|-|-|-|
| [construction](construction/construction.md) | An on/off page that you can easily hide your website behind when making changes or updating it | **@jakubklapka** | 06/21 |
| [cookies](cookies/cookies.md) | A simple cookie popup component that connects user's consent to Google Analytics | **@davidbrzy** | 27/10/21 |
| [editor](cookies/editor.md) | | **@jakubklapka** | 27/10/21 |

<br>

All components must be added to the [**component table**](#components) with their according **name**, **description**, contributing **people** and **date** of creation. When added to the table, the component creator/maintainer must create and maintain the component's own [Markdown](../markdown.md) page according to the [example site](#) below in the components folder.

> Short description included in the table on this site
>
> Much longer description, because it needs larger description, because it needs larger description, because it needs larger description, because it needs larger description, because...

## Ideas

Simply click on any of the items to create the folder path and [Markdown](../markdown.md) file.

|  name | description |

| [calendars](calendars/calendars.md) | Anyone can use [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar) - it's simple and powerful. Let's use this tool to make an event calendar for websites, where they can edit and change events inside Google Calendar and automatically update it on websites |
