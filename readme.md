# Comma

*Comma* is by definition **content management system** designed to make **creating** and **managing** websites easier, but it is much more than that in reality.

> **comma** (noun) [kom-*uh*]
> 1. the sign "**,**", a mark of division used for indicating a division in a sentence
> 2. a **co**ntent-**m**-**ma**nagement system that will change the intentet as we know it

More than 39% percent of all websites on the internet in 2019 are running on WordPress: a great open source content management system. The problem is that as of 2023 it will be 20 years old. Built on old technologies like PHP, WordPress can be slow and ineffective nowadays, that is why we propose a solution: a modern content management system built on new technologies - but at the drawing board, it morphed into something much more.

The Comma should not be called a content management system, but **an ecosystem of technologies**.

## [Docs](docs/docs.md)

A **Comma** website is a collection of [**components**](components/components.md), which are movable *parts of a website* that can be easily added, modified, moved, or removed.

All components being developed can be found in [components](components/components.md) and must be explained documented within their Markdown document.

## [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

*Markdown* is a lightweight markup language created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/) made as an easy-to-write and easy-to-read language for writers. The language can output HTML and any HTML syntax is valid in Markdown. Read more in this [Daring Fireball article](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) by the creator. The language became popular among programmers for its convenience and was popularized as the [README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) language for [GitHub](https://github.com/).
